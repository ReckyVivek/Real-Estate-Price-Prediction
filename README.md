# House Price Prediction in Bangalore

## Overview
This Data Science and Machine Learning project, created by a team of three members (Vivek Kumar Dhoke, Triveni Patle, and Zaira Ali), aims to predict house prices in Bangalore using a Linear Regression model. The project includes a Flask server to deploy a website for users to interact with the prediction model.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered data on house prices in Bangalore, including relevant features like area, number of bedrooms, etc.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset for training the machine learning model.
3. **Model Training:** Utilized a Linear Regression algorithm to train the model on the prepared dataset.
4. **Web Application:** Implemented a Flask server to create a user-friendly website for predicting house prices.

## Features
- **Linear Regression Model:** Accurately predicts house prices based on input features.
- **Web Interface:** Users can input property details and receive instant predictions on the website.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ReckyVivek/minorProject-SIRT.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask server: `python server.py`

## Usage
1. Access the website hosted by the Flask server.
2. Enter property details (area, bedrooms, etc.) in the provided form.
3. Click the "Predict" button to receive the predicted house price.
